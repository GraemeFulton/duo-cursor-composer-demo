This project demonstrates how to create an app using AI tools like Cursor Composer and Claude. It's based on the concepts discussed in the article ["What's Cursor Composer? How to Build Full Apps with AI"](https://prototypr.io/post/cursor-composer-cmdi) by Graeme Fulton.

## About Cursor Composer

Cursor Composer is a powerful feature in the Cursor editor that allows developers to create multi-file applications using AI assistance. It can significantly speed up the development process by handling boilerplate code and complex implementations.

Key features:
- Multi-file editing
- AI-powered code generation
- Accessible via keyboard shortcuts (CMD+I or CMD+SHIFT+I)

## Getting Started

To use Cursor Composer:

1. Install Cursor editor
2. Enable Composer in Cursor Settings
3. Use CMD+I or CMD+SHIFT+I to access Composer
4. Provide instructions to generate your app

## Project Structure

This demo app was created using Cursor Composer and Next.js. It showcases how AI can assist in rapidly prototyping and developing web applications.
